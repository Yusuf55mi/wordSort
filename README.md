# wordSort

Q1) Write a function that sorts a bunch of words by the number of character “a”s within the word
(decreasing order). If some words contain the same amount of character “a”s then you need to
sort those words by their lengths.
Input :
["aaaasd", "a", "aab", "aaabcd", "ef", "cssssssd", "fdz", "kf", "zc", "lklklklklklklklkl", "l"]
Output :
["aaaasd", "aaabcd", "aab", "a", "lklklklklklklklkl", "cssssssd", "fdz", "ef", "kf", "zc", "l"]
